# Sudoku application
Goal: Create a small application where an user can play Sudoku, as well as see it being solved via brute-force (recursion where things are tried until a solution is reached) or attempted via pre-programmed analytical methods.

Already implemented:
* Brute-force solver via recursion.

Next stage:
* Creating a GUI via Pygame where the player can try to solve the Sudoku on their own.
* Animating the brute-force solution, letting the player see what's happening one step at a time.

Future features:
* Programming an analytical solver, starting with the following Sudoku techniques: naked singles, hidden singles, hidden pairs/triples/quadruples, and X-wings.
* Rating Sudokus with the analytical solver, based on how many and which techniques it had to use.
